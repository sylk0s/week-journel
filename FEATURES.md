## Section 1: Requirements (4)
- Week View: The GUI supports displaying a weekly view of days with events and tasks.
- Event and Task Creation: Users can create new events and tasks in the GUI.
- Commitment Warnings: The GUI provides warnings or notifications for exceeding the maximum number of events or tasks in a day.
- Persistence: The GUI supports loading and saving journal entries from/to a file.

## Section 2: Headlining Features (2)
- Task Queue: The GUI includes an expandable sidebar that provides additional functionality or information.
- Menu Bar & Shortcuts: The GUI features a top bar containing buttons for toggling the sidebar, saving the journal, 
adding entries/tasks, start a new week, display the week from a different start day, and opening a bujo file. The GUI 
supports custom key bindings for performing actions, such as:
  - Create New Event cmd/ctrl + e
  - Create New Task cmd/ctrl + t
  - Save cmd/ctrl + s
  - Open cmd/ctrl + o
  - New Week cmd/ctrl + n
  - Start Day cmd/ctrl + d

## Section 3: Power Ups (3)
- Takesie-backsies: Users can delete journal entries from the GUI.
- Progress Bar: Users can view their daily progress on the GUI by seeing a bar at the bottom of their tasks. There is also a
bar on the side toggle so it can show the overall progress of the week's task.
- Weekly Overview: Displays statistics on the side toggle, along with the weekly progress bar, that lets the user know
weekly total events, weekly total tasks, and percentage of tasks completed.

## Section 4: Quality of Life (2)
- Week Start: User can choose what day of the week should be the "start day" of the bullet journal. It can be pressed
at any moment and will smoothly transfer events and tasks along with the days. The week is still in order, no matter the
start day.
- Mind Changes: User can actively edit in the textfields of Event or Task in the week view. This includes name,
description, time and duration (event), and a check if the task is finished (task). All of this information will be 
properly saved as the user types.

## Section 5: Extra Credit
- Splash Screen: When running the program, it shows a "My Journal App" screen that fades away. It lasts for less than
2 seconds, and moves on to the initial view.
- Tested GUI and deployable application via jar
